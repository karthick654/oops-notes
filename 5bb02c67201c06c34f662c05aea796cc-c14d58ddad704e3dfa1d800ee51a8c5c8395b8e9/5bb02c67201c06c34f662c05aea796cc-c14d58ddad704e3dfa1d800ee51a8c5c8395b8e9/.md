### Basic programming

Programming is the process of creating instructions that a computer can follow to accomplish a specific task.

The structure of a C++ program typically includes a main function that serves as the entry point for the program, declarations of variables and functions, and statements that perform specific actions.

### Variables

A variable is a storage location in a computer's memory that has a name and can hold a value. It allows data to be stored, retrieved, and modified during the execution of a program.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    int age = 30;
    std::cout << "My age is " << age << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Data types
Data types define the type of data that can be stored in a variable. There are several built-in data types in C++ which are described below:

- **Integer Types:** Integer types are used to store integer values such as
  1, 2, 3, etc. They are further divided into signed and unsigned
  types. Signed can hold both positive and negative values. Unsigned holds only positive.

- **Floating-Point Types:** Floating-point types are used to store decimal values such as 1.5, 2.7, etc. They are divided into two types: float and double.

- **Character Types:** Character types are used to store characters such as 'a', 'b', etc.

- **Boolean Type:** Boolean type is used to store true/false values.

-  **Void Type:** Void type is used to represent the absence of a value. It is used mainly in functions that do not return a value.

-  **Pointers:** Pointers are used to store the memory addresses of variables. They are used to access variables indirectly.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Integer Types
    int age = 27;
    unsigned int num = 12345;
    cout << "Age: " << age << endl;
    cout << "Number: " << num << endl;
    
    // Floating-Point Types
    float weight = 68.5f;
    double height = 1.75;
    cout << "Weight: " << weight << endl;
    cout << "Height: " << height << endl;
    
    // Character Types
    char letter = 'a';
    cout << "Letter: " << letter << endl;
    
    // Boolean Type
    bool isTrue = true;
    cout << "isTrue: " << isTrue << endl;
    
    // Void Type
    void doSomething() {
        cout << "Doing something..." << endl;
    }
    doSomething();
   
    // Pointers
    int num4 = 42;
    int* p = &num4;
    cout << "Number 4: " << *p << endl;
    
    return 0;
}

```
### Functions

A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions allow you to reuse code, making your programs more modular and easier to maintain.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int num1 = 5;
    int num2 = 10;
    int result = add(num1, num2);
    cout << "The sum of " << num1 << " and " << num2 << " is " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}

```
### Operators

an operator is a symbol that represents a specific operation to be performed on one or more data/values(also known as operand).

###Unary operators

Unary operators are operators that operate on a single operand, Few examples are as follows,

* Increment operator (++): Adds 1 to the operand's value.
```
int x = 5; ++x; // x is now 6
```
* Decrement operator (--): Subtracts 1 from the operand's value.
```cpp
int x = 5; --x; // x is now 4
* ```
* Logical NOT operator (!): Negates the operand's value (changes true to false and vice versa).
```cpp
bool a = true; bool b = !a; // b is now false
* ```

###Binary operators

Binary operators are operators that operate on two operands, Few examples are as follows,

* Addition operator (+): Adds two operands together.
```cpp
int x = 5, y = 10; int z = x + y; // z is now 15
```
* Multiplication operator (*): Multiplies two operands together.
```cpp
Example: int x = 5, y = 10; int z = x * y; // z is now 50
```

### Object oriented programming

OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm that uses objects to represent and manipulate data. In object-oriented programming, data and behavior are bundled together into objects. The upcoming sections will discuss on what an object is, what are the various concepts oops has to offer.

### Class

A class is a blueprint for creating objects that define a set of related data members and member functions. 
* **Data members** are variables/data associated to the class. 
* **Member functions** are functions/action/behaviour specific to the class.

### Object

An object is one instance of the defined class blueprint. Actual memory gets allocated for the class's data members only when the object is created. In the below example, Person is the class and john is the object.

```cpp
class Person {
  //Data members
  public:
    string name;
    int age;
  //Member functions  
    void printInfo() {
      std::cout << "Name: " << name << ", Age: " << age << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
  Person john;
  john.name = "John Smith";
  john.age = 35;
  john.printInfo();
  return 0;
}

```

### Encapsulation


Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and behavior (i.e., methods) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. It is a is a way to restrict the direct access to some components of an object, so users cannot access state values for all of the variables of a particular object.

#### Benefits of encapsulation programming
Encapsulation in programming has a few key benefits. These include:

* **Hiding data:** Users will have no idea how classes are being implemented or stored. All that users will know is that values are being passed and initialized.
* **More flexibility:** Enables you to set variables as read or write-only. Examples include: setName(), setAge() or to set variables as write-only then you only need to omit the get methods like getName(), getAge() etc.
* **Improved maintainability:** Helps to modularize the code and make it easier to modify or update the implementation of a class without affecting other parts of the codebase.

### Constructor

A constructor is a special member function that is automatically called when an object of a class is created. The constructor is used to initialize the object's data members and perform any other necessary setup tasks. A constructor has the same name as the class and no return type (not even void).

There are three different types of constructors, including:

* **Default constructor:** A default constructor is a constructor that takes no arguments. If no constructor is defined for a class, then the compiler automatically generates a default constructor for the class.
```cpp
class Person {
private:
    int age;
    string name;
};
  
public:
    Person() {
        age = 0;
        name = "Unknown";
    }
int main(){
  // Creating an object of Person class using default constructor
  Person p;
  return 0;
}
}
```
* **Parameterized constructor:** A parameterized constructor is a constructor that takes one or more arguments. The arguments are used to initialize the object's data members. The parameterized constructor allows you to initialize the object with specific values when it is created.
```cpp
class Point {
private:
    int x;
    int y;
      
public:
    Point(int x, int y) {
        this->x = x;
        this->y = y;
    }
};
int main()
  // Creating an object of Point class using parameterized constructor
  Point p(5, 10);
  
  // Creating an object of Point class using parameterized constructor
  Point p(5, 10);
  return 0;
}
```
**Copy Constructor:** A copy constructor is a constructor that takes an object of the same class as a parameter. The copy constructor is used to create a new object that is a copy of the original object. The copy constructor initializes the new object's data members to the same values as the original object's data members.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class Person {
private:
    int age;
    string name;
      
public:
    Person(int age, string name) {
        this->age = age;
        this->name = name;
    }

    // Copy constructor
    Person(const Person& p) {
        age = p.age;
        name = p.name;
    }

};

int main() {
    // Creating an object of Person class using parameterized constructor
    Person p1(30, "John");

    // Creating a new object of Person class by copying an existing object
    Person p2 = p1;

    // Displaying the data of both objects
    cout << "Person 1: " << p1.getName() << " (Age: " << p1.getAge() << ")" << endl;
    cout << "Person 2: " << p2.getName() << " (Age: " << p2.getAge() << ")" << endl;

    return 0;
}

```

### Destructor

a destructor is a special member function of a class that is called automatically when an object of the class is destroyed. The destructor is used to define logic to be executed when the object is destroyed. (It maybe used for printing, memory de-allocation etc.)

A destructor is identified by its name, which is the same as the class name preceded by a tilde (~). It is declared in the class definition without any arguments or return type. Here's an example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class MyClass {
   private:
      int *ptr;
   public:
      // Constructor
      MyClass() {
         ptr = new int;
         cout << "Constructor called!" << endl;
      }
      // Destructor
      ~MyClass() {
         delete ptr;
         cout << "Destructor called!" << endl;
      }
};

int main() {
   // Create an object of MyClass
   MyClass obj;
   // Do some work with the object
   // ...
   // The destructor of the object will be called automatically when it goes out of scope
   return 0;
}

```

### Inheritance

Inheritance is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. The class that inherits from another class is called the derived class or subclass, while the class that is inherited from is called the base class or superclass.

* **Single Inheritance:**
  Single inheritance is a type of inheritance in which a derived class inherits from only one base class. For example:
```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    void draw() {
        // Draw the shape
    }
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() {
        // Draw the circle
    }
};

```

* **Multiple Inheritance:**
Multiple inheritance is a type of inheritance in which a derived class inherits from two or more base classes. For example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// First base class
class LivingBeing {
   public:
      void eat() {
         cout << "I can eat!" << endl;
      }
};

// Second base class
class Bird {
   public:
      void fly() {
         cout << "I can fly!" << endl;
      }
};

// Derived class
class Eagle: public LivingBeing, public Bird {
   public:
      void soar() {
         cout << "I can soar!" << endl;
      }
};

int main() {
   // Create an object of derived class
   Eagle e;
   // Call base class functions
   e.eat();
   e.fly();
   // Call derived class function
   e.soar();
   return 0;
}

```
* **Hierarchical Inheritance:**
Hierarchical inheritance is a type of inheritance in which multiple derived classes inherit from the same base class. For example:

```cpp
class Vehicle {
public:
    void move() {
        // Move the vehicle
    }
};

class Car : public Vehicle {
public:
    void drive() {
        // Drive the car
    }
};

class Bike : public Vehicle {
public:
    void ride() {
        // Ride the bike
    }
};

```
* **Multi-level Inheritance:**
Multi-level inheritance is a type of inheritance in which a derived class inherits from another derived class. For example:

```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    void eat() {
        // Eat food
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void bark() {
        // Bark
    }
};

class Bulldog : public Dog {
public:
    void drool() {
        // Drool
    }
};

```

* **Hybrid Inheritance:**
Hybrid inheritance is a type of inheritance in which two or more types of inheritance are used together

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Base class
class Animal {
   protected:
      int age;
   public:
      void eat() {
         cout << "I can eat!" << endl;
      }
};

// Derived from Animal class
class Dog: public Animal {
   public:
      void bark() {
         cout << "I can bark!" << endl;
      }
};

// Derived from Animal class
class Cat: public Animal {
   public:
      void meow() {
         cout << "I can meow!" << endl;
      }
};

// Derived from Dog class
class Labrador: public Dog {
   public:
      void color() {
         cout << "I am black in color." << endl;
      }
};

// Derived from Cat class
class Persian: public Cat {
   public:
      void color() {
         cout << "I am white in color." << endl;
      }
};

// Derived from Labrador class
class Retriever: public Labrador {
   public:
      void fetch() {
         cout << "I can fetch!" << endl;
      }
};

// Derived from Persian class
class Siamese: public Persian {
   public:
      void play() {
         cout << "I can play!" << endl;
      }
};

int main() {
   // Create objects of derived classes
   Retriever r;
   Siamese s;
   // Call base class functions
   r.eat();
   s.eat();
   // Call derived class functions
   r.bark();
   s.meow();
   // Call functions of multilevel inheritance
   r.color();
   s.color();
   r.fetch();
   s.play();
   return 0;
}

```

### Access specifier

An access specifier is a keyword that determines the accessibility of class members (i.e., data members and member functions) from outside the class.

There are three types of access specifiers in C++:

* **Public:** Members declared as public are accessible from anywhere in the program. They can be accessed by objects of the class, functions outside the class, and inherited classes.

* **Private:** Members declared as private are only accessible within the class. They cannot be accessed by objects of the class, functions outside the class, or inherited classes.

* **Protected:** Members declared as protected are accessible within the class and its derived classes. They cannot be accessed by objects of the class or functions outside the class, but can be accessed by derived classes.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class MyClass {
   public:
      int publicMember; // public member
   private:
      int privateMember; // private member
   protected:
      int protectedMember; // protected member
};

class DerivedClass : MyClass{
  DerivedClass(){
    protectedMember=0; // Accessible
    // privateMember=0 // Not accessible
  }
}

int main() {
   MyClass obj;
   obj.publicMember = 10; // Accessible
   // obj.privateMember = 20; // Not accessible
   // obj.protectedMember = 30; // Not accessible
   return 0;
}

```

### Abstraction

Abstraction refers to the process of hiding complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the essential features or functionality to the users.

There are two types of abstraction.

* **Data Abstraction** - Few or all Data members access is restricted with private or protected access specifiers as per requirement.
* **Process Abstraction** - Few or all member function access is restricted with private or protected access specifers as per requirement.

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism means "many forms," which refers to the ability of an object to take on many different forms or behaviors based on the context in which it is used.

There are two main types of polymorphism:

* **Compile-time Polymorphism** (also known as Static Polymorphism, Static binding):
  
  Compile-time polymorphism refers to the use of overloaded functions/operators to perform different operations based on the arguments passed to them. The compiler determines which method to call based on the number, type, and order of the arguments. Function overloading is an example for compile time polymorphism.

  * **Function overloading**
    Function overloading is a compile time polymorphism feature available in many programming languages. It allows multiple functions with the same name to exist in the same scope, as long as they have different parameter lists. When a function is called, the appropriate version of the function is chosen based on the number, types, and order of the arguments passed to it.
  ```cpp
  // Function with two integer parameters
  int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
  }
  
  // Function with two double parameters
  double add(double a, double b) {
  return a + b;
  }
  
  // Function with three integer parameters
  int add(int a, int b, int c) {
  return a + b + c;
  }
    * ```
* **Run-time Polymorphism** (also known as Dynamic Polymorphism / Dynamic Binding):

  Run-time polymorphism refers to the use of inheritance and virtual functions to allow objects of different classes to be treated as if they are of the same class. The method that is called is determined at run-time based on the actual type of the object. Function overriding is an example of run time polymorphism.
  * **Function overriding** Function overriding is a concept in object-oriented programming where a derived class provides a different implementation of a function that is already defined in its base class. The derived class function must have the same name, return type, and arguments as the base class function.
  We use virtual functions in C++ to achieve polymorphism.

  ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
  
  using namespace std;
  
  class Animal {
    public:
      virtual void speak() {
        cout << "Animal speaks!" << endl;
      }
  };
  
  class Dog : public Animal {
    //Overriding the virtual function in base class
    public:
      void speak() {
        cout << "Dog barks!" << endl;
      }
  };
  
  int main() {
    Animal *a = new Animal();
    Dog *d = new Dog();
    Animal *a2=new Dog();
  
    a->speak();  // Output: Animal speaks!
    d->speak();  // Output: Dog barks!
  ``a2->speak();  // Output: Dog barks!
  
    delete a;
    delete d;
  
    return 0;
  }
  
  ```
  
### Message passing

Message passing is a technique for objects to communicate with each other by sending messages. A message is a request for an object to perform a particular action, and it includes information such as the name of the method to be executed and any arguments that are needed.

For example : 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class Customer {
public:
    void deposit(double amount) {
        // Deposit money into the customer's account
        std::cout << "Depositing $" << amount << " into account." << std::endl;
    }

    void request_loan(double amount) {
        // Request a loan from the bank
        std::cout << "Requesting a loan of $" << amount << "." << std::endl;
    }
};

class Banker {
public:
    void approve_loan(double amount) {
        // Approve the loan request
        std::cout << "Approved a loan of $" << amount << "." << std::endl;
    }

    void reject_loan(double amount) {
        // Reject the loan request
        std::cout << "Rejected a loan of $" << amount << "." << std::endl;
    }
};

class Bank {
public:
    void submit_request(double amount) {
        // Submit the loan request to the banker for approval
        banker.approve_loan(amount);
    }

private:
    Banker banker;
};

int main() {
    Customer customer;
    Bank bank;
    Banker banker;

    customer.deposit(500.0);
    customer.request_loan(100.0);

    bank.submit_request(100.0);
    banker.approve_loan(100.0);

    return 0;
}

```

We have defined classes for Bank, Customer, Banker. Let's see the possible message passing scenarios.

* When a customer wants to deposit money, he will call the deposit(500). (customer object->bank object)
* When a customer wants loan he requests the bank with request_loan(100) method call. (customer object->bank object)
* The bank object submits the customer request to the banker for approval with submit_request(100) method call. (bank object-> banker object)
* The banker then conveys if the loan request is approved or not with approve_loan(100) / reject_loan(100) method call. (banker object -> bank object)

This simple example shows how objects can communicate with each other with message passing concept.
